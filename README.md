# PasswordManager (Final Project)
##### *~ for Computer Programming 11 online course ~*

---

### Requirements:

> For the final project of the course you are to utilize everything that we have covered so far to create an application for yourself.  You are to come up with a project of a program that you wish to build.  As long as it meets the criteria you can build anything you like.  It can be difficult to come up with an application that is both useful and within the scope of this course.  For example networks and databases are a skill set we do not have so make sure the app you are designing will not require something like this.  If you are unsure if your idea is within the scope of this course send me an email and I will let you know.  Here is the criteria for the application:
> 
> 1. Contain a minimum of 3 classes outside your main class
> 
> 2. A minimum of 3 methods that are being used must have been tested inside Junit
> 
> 3. Your app must contain a GUI using javafx
> 
> 4. Your app must utilize data persistence
> 
> 5. It must have a purpose or function
